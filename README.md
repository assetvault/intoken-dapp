# InToken √êapp and Smart Contracts

Public repository for source code of the `InToken` \& `InShare` [ERC-20](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard)/223 tokens and associated Smart Contracts related to the ecosystem.

## Abstract

- `InToken` is a utility token for businesses to reward a community of people who make them introductions to customers. 

- `InShare` is a crypto-security that pays community members token dividends on regular intervals. `InShares` can be earned by making introductions to businesses who are listed as qualified vendors on the Inbot Ambassador platform.

- `InScore` is a smart contract that manages the compensation multiplier of Ambassadors. This is an automated way of enforcing good behavior of the community members.

- `Inbot Mediator Gateway` automates the processes of opening an intro bid, contracting the ambassador, mediating the result, and in case of successful delivery, automatically transferring the rewards to the ambassador's token address.

## Main contracts
*  **InToken**

Serves as the main governing smart contaract for INT tokens. Allows to transfer, mint and burn `InTokens`. 

*  **InShare**

Serves as the main governing smart contaract for INS crypto-security. Designed to distribute and rollout dividents in terms of INT tokens to a community. Allows to transfer, mint and burn `InShares` but transfers are disabled at the deployment.  

*  **InScore (IN\%)**

Contract stores trust scores of ambassadors and vendors. Allows to increase or decrease scores for sibling contracts and admin users. 

*  **Inbot Mediator Gateway**

Serves and operates intro workflows. Contains transparently our business logics of rewarding ambassadors (and discouraging dishonest actors) for making introductions in terms of INT tokens and INS crypto-securities.
